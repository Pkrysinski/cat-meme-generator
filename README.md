## Project Title
Cat Meme Generator

## Project Description
Well we all love cats and dogs.  We've decided to move forward making a cat-related API that serves 2 purposes - first to allow the user to generate a cat-related MEME, and second to provide the user with cat facts.

## User Stories
Given a user wants to visit the cat meme/fact website...

WHEN I visit the page,
THEN I am greeted with a textbox which takes in meme text, and placeholder areas for a cat meme and a cat fact.

WHEN I click on "generate meme/fact",
THEN the application takes the text in the input box and generates a meme with it using the first API).

WHEN I click on "generate meme/fact",
THEN the application generates a random cat fact (using the second API).
